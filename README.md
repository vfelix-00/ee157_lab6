# Lab 6: Servo Control Lab 

Vanessa Felix

Lab Partner: Vivian Auduong, Jaden Redhair 

## Overview 

In this lab, we took a hobby servo with the control board removed and designed our own
analog PID controller and PWM generator with an H-bridge driver IC. The hobby servos
were modified so that we would have access to the three potentiometer terminals, as well as the
two terminals of the brushed DC motor. 

The objectives of this lab were:
- Learn about pulse width modulation (PWM) and create a circuit that generates PWM signals that control the voltage on a brushed DC motor. 
- Learn about and create a closed-loop position control for a servo drive using an analog PID controller.
-  Experiment with and understand the practical considerations when designed position controllers for servo applications.
