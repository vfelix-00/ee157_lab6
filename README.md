# Lab 6: Servo Control Lab 

Vanessa Felix

Lab Partner: Vivian Auduong, Jaden Redhair 

## Overview 

In this lab, we took a hobby servo with the control board removed and designed our own
analog PID controller and PWM generator with an H-bridge driver IC. The hobby servos
were modified so that we would have access to the three potentiometer terminals, as well as the
two terminals of the brushed DC motor.
